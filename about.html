<h1>WHAT IS CYBER SECURITY?</h1>
<body>
    <P>
        Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.<br> With the increasing reliance on digital technologies in almost every aspect of modern life,<br> cybersecurity has become critically important. It encompasses a wide range of measures<br> and practices aimed at preventing unauthorized access, data breaches,<br> theft of sensitive information, and other cyber threats.<br></P>

        <h1>Cybersecurity Overview:</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Network Security</h2>
            <p>This involves securing computer networks from unauthorized access or misuse. It includes measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and virtual private networks (VPNs) to protect against external threats.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Endpoint Security</h2>
            <p>This focuses on securing individual devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. Endpoint security solutions include antivirus software, encryption tools, and application control mechanisms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Protection</h2>
            <p>Data is a valuable asset for individuals and organizations, and protecting it from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration is crucial. Data protection measures include encryption, access controls, and regular data backups.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2>
            <p>IAM systems ensure that only authorized individuals have access to systems and data. This involves user authentication, access control policies, and multi-factor authentication mechanisms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Application Security</h2>
            <p>Applications, including web applications and mobile apps, are common targets for cyber attacks. Application security involves identifying and patching vulnerabilities in software, as well as implementing secure coding practices during development.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Security Awareness Training</h2>
            <p>Human error is a significant factor in many cyber incidents, so educating users about cybersecurity best practices is essential. Security awareness training helps individuals recognize potential threats such as phishing emails and social engineering attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Incident Response and Management</h2>
            <p>Despite best efforts, security breaches can still occur. Having a robust incident response plan in place enables organizations to detect, contain, and recover from security incidents effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Regulatory Compliance</h2>
            <p>Many industries are subject to regulatory requirements regarding data protection and cybersecurity. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is essential for avoiding legal penalties and maintaining trust with customers.</p>
