<pre>Based on the search results, a sample of food in Mombasa could include:

    Bhajias, which are popular East African snacks with origins in India, made from various vegetables dipped in a spiced gram flour batter and deep-fried.
    Mahamris, a special type of triangle-shaped doughnut flavored with coconut and cardamom, usually served with gunga peas cooked in coconut milk.
    Mogo, which is grilled or fried cassava seasoned with a blend of salt, chili, sugar, and lime.
    Grilled sweet corn, garnished with lime and chili.
    Grilled sweet potato, seasoned with chili and salt.

        <section id="about-mesosphere">
            <h2>What is the Mesosphere?</h2>
            <p>The mesosphere (/ˈmɛsəˌsfɪər, ˈmɛz-, ˈmiːsə-, -zə-/) is Earth's third atmospheric layer, situated directly above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere.  A defining characteristic of the mesosphere is the steady decrease in temperature with increasing altitude.</p>
            <p>The mesosphere's boundaries are determined by the stratopause (top of the stratosphere) and the mesopause (coldest part of the atmosphere). These boundaries can vary depending on location and season, with higher boundaries in winter and the tropics, and lower boundaries in summer and at the poles. Generally, the lower boundary ranges from 47 to 51 km (29 to 32 mi), and the upper boundary (mesopause) ranges from 85 to 100 km (53 to 62 mi).</p>

        <section id="middle-atmosphere">
            <h2>The Middle Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The mesosphere and the layer below it, the stratosphere, are sometimes referred to collectively as the "middle atmosphere." This region spans roughly between 12 and 80 km above Earth's surface.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="mesopause">
            <h2>The Mesopause and Beyond</h2>
            <p>The mesopause, located at an altitude of 80-90 km, separates the mesosphere from the thermosphere. Interestingly, the mesopause nearly coincides with the turbopause. The turbopause is the region where different gases in the atmosphere are well-mixed due to turbulent eddies. Above this level, the atmosphere becomes less uniform because the scale heights of different gases vary based on their molecular masses.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="near-space">
            <h2>Near Space: A Fuzzy Boundary</h2>
            <p>The term "near space" is sometimes used to describe regions within the mesosphere. It lacks a precise technical definition but typically refers to the area roughly between the Armstrong Limit (19 km) and the Kármán Line (where aerodynamics give way to astrodynamics for flight). Alternatively, it can refer to the space between the highest commercial airline flight altitude (12.2 km) and the lowest perigee of orbiting satellites (73 km).</p>
